/**
 * In the Openflexo Viewpoint Architecture a {@link ViewPoint} is the metamodel level of model federation.<br>
 * A {@link View} (run-time context of model federation) is conform to a {@link ViewPoint}.<br>
 * 
 * A viewpoint partitions the set preoccupations of the stakeholders so that issues related to such preoccupation subsets can be addressed
 * separately. Viewpoints provide the convention, rules and modelling technologies for constructing, presenting and analysing Views. It can
 * address one or several existing sources of informations (in which we can find models or metamodels).<br>
 * 
 * Viewpoints also propose dedicated tools for presenting and manipulating data in the particular context of some stakeholderâs
 * preoccupations.
 * 
 * An Openflexo View is the instantiation of a particular Viewpoint with its own Objective relevant to some of the preoccupations of the
 * Viewpoint.
 * 
 * A Viewpoint addresses some preoccupations of the real world. A View is defined for a given objective and for a particular stakeholder or
 * observer.
 * 
 * A Viewpoint provides:
 * <ul>
 * <li>model extensions to model information relevant to a given context;</li>
 * <li>manipulation primitives (EditionSchemes) involving one or many models;</li>
 * <li>tools to create and edit models using model manipulation primitives;</li>
 * <li>tools to import existing models;</li>
 * <li>graphical representation of manipulated models, with dedicated graphical editors (diagrams, tabular and textual views).</li>
 * </ul>
